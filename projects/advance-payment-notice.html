        <h2>Automated Advance Payment Notification System</h2>
        <div class="case-study-content">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>As a Senior ABAP Developer, I collaborated with an SAP FICO Consultant to automate the process of generating and distributing advance payment notices, which was previously a manual task. I developed a program to streamline this process, producing PDF reports and sending email notifications.</p>
            
            <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
            <p>Built an ABAP program in the SAP FICO module, using Smart Forms to generate PDF reports for advance payment notices. Integrated email functionality to automatically send notifications to vendors, retrieving data such as vendor details, invoice items, and payment amounts from SAP tables. Implemented error handling and logging to ensure reliable processing.</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/advance-payment-pseudo-code.png" alt="Pseudo-Code for Generating the PDF and attach in the email notification" class="case-study-image" loading="lazy">

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>The main challenge was ensuring accurate data retrieval and formatting for both PDF reports and emails, especially when handling multiple vendors and payment records. I addressed this by optimizing database queries and adding validation checks to maintain data integrity.</p>
            
            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>The program improved financial operations by automating the notification process, reducing manual effort for the finance team, and ensuring timely communication with vendors.</p>
            
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>This project taught me the importance of efficient data retrieval in SAP for large datasets. I also learned to design automated workflows that balance performance with user-friendly output, such as clear PDF reports and email notifications.</p>
